# Attendance

## Policy

Class begins at 09:00, sharp every weekday. There will be a break for lunch at 12:00, resuming class at 13:00. Attendance is taken at 09:00 and at 13:00. If you are not in class and seated at those times, you will be considered tardy. If you are not in class with 15 minutes (i.e., 09:15 and 13:15), you will be considered absent.

Three (3) tardies count as an absence. Two (2) absences will make you ineligible for graduation.

Repeated tardiness and absences may result in denial for future eligibility of courses through the MiSK foundation.

Of course, delays can happen. The solution is to leave every day earlier than you think you should. The instructors are on-time every day and we live all over the area. **If the instructors can do it, so can you!**

If you do arrive late, we ask that you not enter the classrooms until they go on break. Having folks coming in late is a distraction to the instructors and students.

## In sum: 3 tardies = 1 absence. 2 absences = No Graduation
