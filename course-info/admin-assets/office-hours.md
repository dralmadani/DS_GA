# Office Hours

The instructors will be around for about half an hour after class ends if you have questions, and can be reached via Slack, although they may not respond immediately.

We will also have an Instructor Associate, Matt Speck, holding office hours remotely Sunday through Wednesday from 1900 to 2100. You can book time with Matt here:

Please note that bookings are in 15 minute increments, and come with specific questions for Matt.
