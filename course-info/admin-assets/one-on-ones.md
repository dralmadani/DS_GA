# One-on-Ones

You will have a one-on-one with an instructor by appointment. Please reach out to your instructor to set one up.

They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-ones might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!

One-on-ones are usually 15 minutes. They can be longer or shorter depending on what needs you express.
