    "**[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)** is a database software package built on the Structured Query Language [(SQL)](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/). It is similar to other SQL databases, such as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, except it is *file-based* rather than *server-based*. This makes it easy to set up and use for small projects but less suitable for production environments. Once you are familiar with SQLite, the same ideas and similar syntax can be applied to other SQL databases.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. SQLite command line utility\n",
    "2. Python's `sqlite3` package\n",

Behind the scenes, the Structured Query Language (SQL) itself defines the interface to the database software. This underlying SQL syntax will be visible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the method chosen."
